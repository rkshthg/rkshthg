# Hi there! I'm Rakshith

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Data Engineer with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and data warehousing principles. I design, develop, and maintain robust and scalable ETL/ELT pipelines for processing large datasets using technologies like Python, SQL and Spark on cloud platforms. I'm passionate about data modeling, data quality, and data pipelines, and eager to contribute to innovative data solutions that drive business value.

## What I Do

I specialize in building and optimizing data pipelines, leveraging cloud technologies and big data tools. My experience includes working with AWS services, Apache Spark, and various database systems. I'm particularly interested in data engineering, data warehousing, and cloud computing.

## My Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

* **AWS Data Pipeline Project:** This project implements a highly scalable data processing pipeline on AWS, designed to efficiently handle large volumes of JSON data. The pipeline reads JSON data from S3, streams it through Kinesis to Lambda for processing.  Spark on EMR transforms the data, and the refined data is written in Delta format in Delta Lake.
