# Hi there! I'm Rakshith

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Data Engineer, currently building my skills and experience in this exciting field. I have a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and data warehousing principles, and I'm actively practicing and learning on the go. I'm eager to contribute to innovative data solutions and expand my knowledge in areas like cloud computing and big data technologies.

## What I Do

I'm focused on developing my data engineering skills through hands-on projects and continuous learning. I'm currently working on mastering Apache Spark, exploring AWS cloud services, modelling data, and building ETL pipelines.  I'm particularly interested in data warehousing, real-time data processing, cloud-based data solutions.

## My Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

* **AWS Data Pipeline Project:** This project implements a highly scalable data processing pipeline on AWS, designed to efficiently handle large volumes of JSON data. The pipeline reads JSON data from S3, streams it through Kinesis to Lambda for processing.  Spark on EMR transforms the data, and the refined data is written in Delta format in Delta Lake.
